## 🔒 Private plugins
Well, private and private. We release everything publicly on Github because, why not? Thease plugins *can technically* be used on your own server but they have been specifically developed for endi.club.
### Endihub
> Our hub plugin that does pretty much everything in the hub.
>
> [Source](https://github.com/endi-club/endihub) | [Latest Build](https://nightly.link/endi-club/Endihub/workflows/maven/main?preview "This uses nighly.link a service that automatically pulls the latest artifact generated by Github Actions. If you would like to not use a Third-party service, manually find the last action ran and download the artifact from there.")
### Endiproxy
> Just some stuff we need on proxy level such as staff chat and some custom commands. **⚠️ Currently broken**
>
> [Source](https://github.com/endi-club/endiproxy) | [Latest Build](https://nightly.link/endi-club/Endiproxy/workflows/build/main?preview "This uses nighly.link a service that automatically pulls the latest artifact generated by Github Actions.
